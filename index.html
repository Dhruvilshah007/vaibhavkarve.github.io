==========================================
Welcome to Vaibhav Karve's GitHub website.
==========================================


About me:
========
I am a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I like dabbling in logic, algebra, topology and geometry
(which is to say I know none of these properly and only pretend to work with them).

I absolutely love coding in Python and LaTeX (if tex can be called code).
I am still trying to learn SageMath and PlainTeX.

A more traditional website will soon appear at this URL, with proper formatting.

For now, I am too busy reading the following books and can't be bothered to learn HTML.


Novels I am currently reading:
=============================
1. The Checklist Manifesto (Atul Gawande)
2. Arkham Asylum (Graphic book)
3. Turtles All the Way Down (John Green)
4. Two Towers (from LOTR, by JRRT)


Textbooks I am currently reading:
================================
1. Notes on Logic and Set Theory (P.T.Johnstone)
2. Logic and Structure (Dirk van Dalen)
3. The TeXbook (Donald Knuth)
4. Mathematical Computation with SageMath (Paul Zimmerman et.al.)
