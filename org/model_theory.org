#+title: Model theory

- Reference :: Taken from my reading of David Marker's Model Theory:
               an introduction.

* Structures and theories
A /structure/ is a set that we wish to study equipped with collection
of distinguished functions, relations, and elements. We also choose a
/language/ (which is a set of symbols) to express statements about the
structure.

- Def :: A /language/ \(L\) is given by specifying the following:
- \(F\) := a set of function symbols
- \(n_f : \mathbb{N}\) for every \(f \in F\) i.e., the /arity/ of each function.
- \(R\) := a set of relation symbols
- \(n_r : \mathbb{N}\) for every \(r \in R\) i.e., the /arity/ of each relation.
- \(C\) := a set of constant symbols.
