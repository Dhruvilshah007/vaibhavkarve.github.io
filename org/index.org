I am a PhD student at the [[https://math.illinois.edu/academics/graduate-program/funding/graduate-awards-and-fellowships/david-g-bourgin-mathematics][Department of Mathematics]] at the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

My research interests lie in graph theory, logic, algorithms and
computational topology. I am currently writing my doctoral thesis,
titled /Graphical structure of unsatisfiable boolean formulas/ which
combines the tools of graph theory and topology to analyze boolean
satisfiability -- a classic problem in logic and computer science that
asks if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a boolean
formula.

I am also looking to extend my doctoral work towards the upcoming and
adjacent field of formalized mathematics (a computer-assisted
approach) and interactive theorem proving.
