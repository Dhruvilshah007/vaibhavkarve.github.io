  They are another way to represent a regular language.  ∅ is the
  language that contains no symbols. ε is the language that only
  contains the empty string. These are to different languages and are
  accepted by two different DFAs.

Regular expression can contain:
1. ∅, ε
2. Any character in Σ
3. Parentheses, for grouping.
4. Concatenation
5. Union, ∪ or |
6. Kleene star * (binds tighter than all other symbols)

Any finite language is regular -- we can just list out all the
elements.

Regular language ↔ ∃ a DFA that accepts it ↔ there is a 

_Pumping lemma_ is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a
language to be regular.

Examples of non-regular language:
1. L = {1ⁿ where n is prime}
2. L = {1ⁿ where n is composite}

Pushdown automata (PDA) are automata with stacks (read from top of
stack and then shove any number of symbols on top). Change of state
can depend on the input (top element of stack).

A language recognized by a PDA is called *context-free*. PDAs have
arbitrarily large memory (unlike DFAs) but they don't have arbitrary
access!

Context-free grammars (CFG) are another way to write context-free
languages. What makes a CFG context free is that its rules are for
replacing a single variable at a time in a way that is independent of
other surrounding characters.

CFGs are *not* closed under intersection and complementation!
Non-example of CFG is: {aⁿbⁿcⁿ : n ∈ ℕ}.
