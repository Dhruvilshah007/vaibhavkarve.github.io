* Affine spaces
** Definition
   An /affine space/ is:
   - a set $\Epsilon$
   - with the data of a vector space $E$(over a field of
     characteristic $0$)
   - and a mapping $\Theta : \Epsilon\times\Epsilon \longrightarrow$.
   - Furthermore, if $\Theta: (A, B)\mapsto\vec{AB}$, then we need the
     partial map $\Theta_A : B \mapsto \vec{AB}$ to be a bijection
     from $\Epsilon$ to $E$.
   - Also (Chasles' relation), $\forall A B C \in\Epsilon, \vec{AB} =
     \vec{AC} + \vec{CB}$.  This is essentially the law of vector
     addition.

   $\Theta$ identifies vectors in $E$ with orderd pairs of points in
   the affine space $\Epsilon$.

   Dimension of $\Epsilon$ is the dimension of $E$.

   *Instance:* Every vector space is canonically an affine space by
   choosing $\Theta: (u, v) \mapsto v - u$.  Every affine space can be
   made a vector space by picking an origin point, but this is
   non-canonical since it depends on the choice of point.

   Chasles' relation implies $\vec{AA} = 0$ and $\vec{AB} =
   -\vec{BA}$.  It also implies that parallelogram rule of vector
   addition: \[\vec{AB} = \vec{A'B'} \iff \vec{AA'} = \vec{BB'}.\]

   An /affine subspace/ is a subset of an affine space $\Epsilon$ such
   that image of subset under partial map $\Theta_A$ (for some
   $A\in\Epsilon$) is a vector subspace of $E$.  Then we can define
   /points/, /lines/ and /planes/ to just be affine subspaces of
   dimension 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

   Point $A_0, A_1, \ldots, A_k$ are /affinely independent/ if the
   dimension of the affine space they span is $k$.  If $k =
   dim(\Epsilon)$, then it is said that $(A_0, \ldots, A_k)$ is an
   /affine frame/ of $\Epsilon$.  For example, an affine frame on a
   line has two distinct points.

   An /affine map/ is a map $\phi: \Epsilon_1 \rightarrow \Epsilon_2$
   if there exists a point $O$ (which we can call the origin) and a
   linear map $f: E \rightarrow F$ such that $\forall A\in\Epsilon$,
   \[f(\vec{OA}) = \vec{\phi(O)\phi(A)}.\]

   The affine bijections from $\Epsilon$ to itself form a group under
   composition called the /affine group/ $GA(\Epsilon)$.

** Facts 
 Any affine subspace of $\Epsilon$ can be written as $V + \vec{v}$,
 where $V$ is a vector subspace of $E$ and $\vec{v}\in E$.  The vector
 subspaces are precisely the affine subspaces with $\vec{v}=0$. (See
 also analogous result for affine maps).

 An intersection of affine subspaces is an affine subspace.

 The underlying vector space gives the ``direction'' to an affine
 space. This lets us also talk about parallel affine spaces (they have
 the same direction).

 If $f : E \rightarrow V$ is a _linear_ map then $f^{-1}(v)$ for any
 $v\in F$ is an affine subspace of the affine space $E$ having
 $Ker(f)$ as its underlying vector space. Moreover, $f^{-1}(v)$ is
 parallel to every other $f^{-1}(v')$.

 If $\Epsilon_1, \Epsilon_2$ are parallel, they are either equal or
 disjoint.

 *Surprisingly:* the parallel axiom (there exists a line parallel to a
 given line through a point not on the line) is true in any affine
 space (because it is actually a consequence of vector space axioms
 and hence of the definition of parallelism).

 As a result of this definition of affine maps, given an affine map,
 we can always define a canonical linear map. For example, the linear
 map associated to the affine map $x\mapsto ax+b$ is $x\mapsto ax$.
 Every affine map $phi$ can be written as $\phi(v) = f(v) + v_0$ for
 some linear map $f$ and some vector $v_0$. (See analogous result for
 affine subspaces).

 The forward as well as inverse image of an affine space by an affine
 map is an affine space.  The composition of two affine mappings is an
 affine mapping.

 *Surprisingly:* The fact that the three medians of a triangle meet at
 a single point is a consequence of the _associativity_ of computing
 barycenters (centers of gravity) of a system of masses.

 Any intersection of convex subsets is convex.

 The forward and inverse image of a convex subset by an affine mapping
 is convex.

** Theorems
*** Thales' theorem
    This theorem states that projections are affine
    maps. Equivalently, any transversal cutting accross three fixed
    parallel lines will have ``segements'' cut by the parallel lines
    in a fixed ratio.
